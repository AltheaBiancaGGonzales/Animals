# Animals (Hi sir nahihirapan po akong ilagay sa replit kasi mabagal :c)

In this activity, your task is to create an object-oriented program to demonstrate Inheritance and Polymorphism. You are free to choose which functions, or variables you would like to create. The only rule is that the parent class must be "Animal" and its child classes must be "Mammal, Bird, Reptile, Amphibian, Invertebrates, and Fish". 

As an idea of how this activity can be done; An animal can be a mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, and so on. Animals have distinct sounds, and unique characteristics. Some animals have feet, some have wings, and some have tails. There will be no one solution for this activity, your score will be determined by code quality and uniqueness.
